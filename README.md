# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivations for this webpage were to create a centralised place for all of my notes from the prework, as well as to put into practice what I was learning. During the course of the build I learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, which all helped me solve the problem of how to build a webpage. 

## Installation

## Usage

The webpage displays the four topics we have learned about. Feel free to read as much as you please. If you open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript code running as it displays the four topics, and gives us one to start with first at random.
